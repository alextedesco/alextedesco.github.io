      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Alex Tedesco, and I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computing & Information Technologies at
        the
        Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm excited to say that I'm entering the third year of studies, and my
        journey in the field of computing has been nothing short of amazing. I approach my work with the belief that my
        skill set
        and dedication would significantly benefit anyone that I work and collaborate with.
        <br><br />

        Ever since I was introduced to my school's local computer club back in 2017, I discovered my passion for
        computing and knew that this
        industry was where I belonged. During my time in computer club, I immersed myself in learning the fundamentals
        of computing. I absorbed
        information like a sponge and I cannot thank my mentors Joe Claus and Donald Kress enough for their involvement
        in my growth.
        It was an incredible experience that solidified my passion for technology and its endless possibilities.


        <br><br />
        Since then, I have eagerly pursued opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge in the computing field. I
        have engaged in various projects, both personal and academic, where I have applied my problem-solving abilities
        and honed my technical expertise.

        <br><br />
        I am fascinated by the ever-evolving nature of technology and its potential to transform the world. The
        innovative solutions and advancements in computing continue to inspire me, and I am eager to be part of this
        dynamic industry.

        <br><br />
        As I continue my educational journey and work towards my degree, I am excited about the opportunities ahead. I
        look forward to exploring new areas of computing, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and contributing
        to the advancements that will shape our future.

      <h2>Projects</h2>


      <h3>Kiwibot</h3>

      <p>Kiwibot is a multi-purpose Discord bot that originated from the need to resolve a reoccurring
        roommate debate over movie choices. As a group, myself and my three roommates have a movie night weekly and we
        frequently
        found ourselves in situations of not knowing what movie to decide on as a group. Eventually the development of
        Kiwibot
        began and now anytime we have this issue, kiwibot comes to the rescue!
        <br><br />

        Kiwibot has the ability to take any two movie titles and seamlessly merge them, offering the perfect movie
        recommendation
        that satisfies everyone's preferences. Beyond its movie-matching prowess, Kiwibot boasts additional features
        that enhance our social experiences.
        It integrates my other projects below allowing for more topic discussion amongst the group. This personal
        project not only
        streamlines decision-making but also showcases my passion for problem-solving and creative bot development.
