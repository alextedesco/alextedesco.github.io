      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Alex Tedesco, and I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computing & Information Technologies at
        the Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm excited to say that I'm entering the third year of studies, and my
        journey in the field of computing has been nothing short of amazing. I approach my work with the belief that my
        skill set and dedication would significantly benefit anyone that I work and collaborate with.
        <br><br>

        Ever since I was introduced to my school's local computer club back in 2017, I discovered my passion for
        computing and knew that this
        industry was where I belonged. During my time in computer club, I immersed myself in learning the fundamentals
        of computing. I absorbed
        information like a sponge and I cannot thank my mentors Joe Claus and Donald Kress enough for their involvement
        in my growth.
        It was an incredible experience that solidified my passion for technology and its endless possibilities.


        <br><br>
        Since then, I have eagerly pursued opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge in the computing field. I
        have engaged in various projects, both personal and academic, where I have applied my problem-solving abilities
        and honed my technical expertise.

        <br><br>
        I am fascinated by the ever-evolving nature of technology and its potential to transform the world. The
        innovative solutions and advancements in computing continue to inspire me, and I am eager to be part of this
        dynamic industry.

        <br><br>
        As I continue my educational journey and work towards my degree, I am excited about the opportunities ahead. I
        look forward to exploring new areas of computing, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and contributing
        to the advancements that will shape our future.

      <h2>Projects</h2>


      <h3>Kiwibot</h3>

      <p>Kiwibot is a multi-purpose Discord bot that originated from the need to resolve a reoccurring
        roommate debate over movie choices. As a group, myself and my three roommates have a movie night weekly and we
        frequently
        found ourselves in situations of not knowing what movie to decide on as a group. Eventually the development of
        Kiwibot
        began and now anytime we have this issue, kiwibot comes to the rescue!
        <br><br>

        Kiwibot has the ability to take any two movie titles and seamlessly merge them, offering the perfect movie
        recommendation
        that satisfies everyone's preferences. Beyond its movie-matching prowess, Kiwibot boasts additional features
        that enhance our social experiences.
        It integrates my other projects below allowing for more topic discussion amongst the group. This personal
        project not only
        streamlines decision-making but also showcases my passion for problem-solving and creative bot development.

      <h3>LastFM API Calling</h3>
      <p>As someone deeply immersed in a vibrant circle of music enthusiasts, I recognized the profound role music plays in my life. 
        It was this realization that drove me to embark on a journey to master the intricacies of the LastFM API, going through the many pages of documentation to do so. 
        The result? A dynamic feature on kiwibot that not only reveals a users recently played tunes but also spotlights the current track being played. 
        Beyond this, I used the API to extract intriguing music-listening statistics from the past month with the ability to set specific parameters. 
        Taking the time to do this allowed my proficiency in API integration, data visualization, JSON and XML parsing, and overall web development.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>PFRScraper</h3>
      <p>PFRScraper is a remarkable personal project that I developed using Python in conjunction with the powerful Beautiful Soup 4 package. This project 
        was designed to streamline the retrieval of comprehensive NFL-related information from Pro Football Reference. With PFRScraper, I can effortlessly 
        extract data such as NFL schedules, player statistics, and NFL rosters. 
        
        <br><br>

        To enhance the user experience further, I integrated PFRScraper with Rotowire, 
        a leading sports news site, to provide real-time updates and the latest NFL news. The synergy between data scraping and news aggregation in this project 
        not only simplifies access to critical NFL data but also keeps users informed with up-to-the-minute insights into the world of professional football. 
        PFRScraper stands as a testament to my programming skills and my commitment to creating tools that simplify and enrich the way we engage with sports statistics 
        and news.</p>

      <h3>Dish Washer</h3>

      <p>
        Less than a mile from my home lies the renowned Moore's Maple Shack, a restaurant steeped in rich family history. 
        Despite not being an immediate family member, I have been closely associated with the Moore family throughout my entire life, 
        and they graciously welcomed me into their tight-knit team. The warm and inclusive atmosphere allowed me to play a significant 
        role in maintaining the smooth operation of this beloved restaurant while preserving its cherished traditions. 
        
        <br><br>
        
        This experience refined my work ethic, enhanced my attention to detail, and deepened my appreciation for teamwork and the preservation of time-honored 
        customs within this cherished family establishment. During my tenure as a dishwasher, I took on the crucial responsibility of 
        meticulously cleaning and drying heavily soiled dishes, ensuring the highest standards of cleanliness and efficiency.
